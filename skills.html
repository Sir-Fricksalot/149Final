			Disc Golf has very few physical limitations. Most anyone who has arms and can walk the course will be perfectly able to play. Most courses are 3-5 miles long, and have benches between most holes for those who need to catch their breath.  While arm strength is required, it is not to a great degree.<br><br>
			As most folfers will attest, the most essential skill in Disc Golf is patience. It can be easy to get frustrated and lose focus. This can quickly lead to a downhill snowball effect on your performance if you can't get over a bad throw or a lonely tree knocking your disc to the ground.<br><br>
			The ability to get along with fellow folfers also cannot be understated. Courses can get crowded, but as long as you stay civil and follow folf courtesy, you are bound to get along great with everyone, and make new friends.
