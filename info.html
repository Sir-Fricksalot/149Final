			<h3>About Disc Golf</h3>
			<p>
				Disc Golf is a game or sport played much like traditional ball golf, where the object is to complete the course in the fewest number of throws possible. However, instead of using a club to hit a ball towards a hole, discs are thrown towards a basket or pole. To complete hole, the disc must hit the pole(at a course with poles), or come to rest in the chains or base of the basket.
				There are typically 18 holes on a course, and the expected number of throws (or "par") is usually 3, but occasionally a par 4 or 5 can be found.
			</p>
			<h3>Courtesy</h3>
			<p>
				Being rude or inconsiderate on the course will quickly lead you out of the good graces of your fellow folfers.  Always make sure to be aware of where other groups and players are when you throw, and be sure to yell "FORE!" after any stray throws. On the other end of things, make sure not to wander across fairways or in front of someone about to throw.
				If you are new to the game, or are with a large group, keep an eye on the group behind you. Offer to let smaller, faster groups pass if they are waiting for you to finish on multiple holes in a row.
