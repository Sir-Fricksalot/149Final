			<h3>Tutorials:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Backhand Throw</b><br>The backhand throw is the way most beginners start throwing. It has the potential to be the distance throw of choice if implemented correctly.<br>
				The wind-up is essential to throwing backhand properly. Take a few steps back from where you intend to release.<br>
				Use your full range of motion. Hold the disc out behind you as you prepare to throw, and turn your body just before releasing to put some extra speed into it.<br>
				Release low, and err to release late. Backhand throws will want to curve to the left for right-handed players. Minimize this effect by keeping your throw as level as possible, and releasing to the right of where you want the disc to land.<br></li>
				<li><b>Sidearm</b><br>Try a practice throw before you go for it. A little muscle memory can go a long way.<br>
				Angle the disc towards you. Sidearm throws will want to curve right for right-handed players, so tilting it slightly to the left can counteract this and even give you extra distance!<br>
				Keep it low. Just like with backhand throws, minimize that final curve by keeping your release as low as you can.<br></li>
				<li><b>Tomahawk/Hammer Toss</b><br>This throw is probably the most versatile technique of the three. It can be useful for up or downhill situations, getting over or through trees and bushes, and can be used with any amount of power.<br>
				Hold your disc vertically. Reach back over your shoulder and then use your whole arm to propel the disc. Try to avoid snapping your wrist, or you might end up throwing your disc at the ground.<br>
				Release early rather than late. It is all too easy to end up throwing your disc right into the trees you were trying to toss it over. Don't forget to follow through.
