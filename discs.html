			<h3>What type of disc should I choose?</h3>
			There are many, many types of folfing discs out there, and each has a time and place. Discs are typically put into one of three categories: driver, mid-range, and putter. There are subcategories of these, and a lot of variation even within those, but if you are new to Disc Golf it shouldn't matter much what you use at first.<br><br> 
			<b>Drivers</b> are for long distance throws, and are a good choice for your first disc, if you're in that market.<br>
			<b>Putters</b> are very stable and easy to throw straight. They are nigh impossible to throw very far, however.<br>
			<b>Mid-range</b> discs are usually the last to be added to a folfer's collection. They combine the predictable flight path and ease-of-use of a putter with the distance and curving capabilities of drivers.
