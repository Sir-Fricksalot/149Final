				As with any sport, there are many terms that sound weird and unfamiliar to beginners. 
				Learn proper usage of these words and you'll have a much easier time communicating with your fellow folfers.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><h4>Folf</h4>-- Combination of the words "Frisbee" and "Golf" used to refer to Disc Golf. Also used with other iterations such as "folfing" and "folfers."</li>
				<li><h4>Hole</h4></li>-- A corresponding basket teepad and fairway, and the surrounding area.
				<li><h4>Drive</h4></li>-- The first throw on a hole. The objective is to close the majority of the distance between the teepad and the basket.
				<li><h4>Teepad</h4></li>-- The surface from which a drive is taken. There is one at the start of each hole.
				<li><h4>Basket</h4></li>-- The container that discs must rest in to complete the hole.
				<li><h4>Fairway</h4></li>-- The central or primary path between the teepad and basket.
				<li><h4>FORE</h4></li>-- This term is used to signal other folfers that a wayward disc is headed in their direction. Yell it loudly.
				<li><h4>Clear</h4></li>-- Referring to a hole that is not actively being played on. It is courteous to yell "Clear!" after completing and leaving a hole in order to signal the next group that the hole is available.
